# Predictive Modeling for Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors
This project focuses on the development of predictive models for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors using machine learning techniques. It includes data retrieval, exploratory data analysis, molecular descriptor calculations, and model optimization using multiple algorithms. 

Aim: The goal of this project is to predict the bioactivity (IC50 values) of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors based on molecular descriptors. This work could be helpful in drug discovery efforts for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.

Key Steps:
- Data Retrieval and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Molecular Descriptor Calculation
- Model Development
- Model Comparison

Future Work:
- Incorporating additional molecular descriptors or other cheminformatics features to improve model accuracy.
- Testing advanced algorithms such as neural networks or deep learning models.
